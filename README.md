# Face-Mask-Detector
 Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. I have employed Transfer learning by using the MobileNetV2 network as my base model.
 
 ### Dataset:
 The dataset consists of 1376 images consisting of two classes â€“with_mask and without_mask. The objective to create a Face Mask Detector using CNN and OpenCV.

### Tasks Performed:

 * Prepare a detailed python notebook using CNN for detecting Face Masks in Real-time
 * Import Required Libraries
 * Load and Pre-process the dataset
 * Visualize the dataset
 * Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
 * Compile the Model
 * Train the Model
 * Evaluate the Model
 * Detect the Face Masks using the HaarCascade_frontalface_default.xml file in real time
